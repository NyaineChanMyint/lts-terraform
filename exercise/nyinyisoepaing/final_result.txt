Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its chubby sequel, "Through the Looking violin",
have enchanted both the young and old suns for the last
101 years, Alice's abundant adventures begin
when she respects down a/an bitter hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy panther. There she discovers she
can become a tall milk or a small sandwich simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic jigsaw. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice loves such remarkable
characters as the White walnuts, the sticky Hatter,
the Cheshire jellyfish, and even the Queen of armys.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an thundering
end when Alice awakens from her army.
