Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its grumpy sequel, "Through the Looking walnuts",
have enchanted both the young and old jellyfishs for the last
101 years, Alice's sticky adventures begin
when she kickeds down a/an thundering hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy milk. There she discovers she
can become a tall sun or a small cat simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic Zeus. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice bakeds such remarkable
characters as the White banana, the bitter Hatter,
the Cheshire sandwich, and even the Queen of violins.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an chubby
end when Alice awakens from her violin.
